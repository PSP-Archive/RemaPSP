Macro Example!
+d_up      # Digital Up
+d_right   # Digital Right
+d_down    # Digital Down
+d_left    # Digital Left
+triangle  # Triangle
+circle    # Circle
+cross     # Cross
+square    # Square
+start     # Start
+select    # Select
+ltrigger  # L Trigger
+rtrigger  # R Trigger
+ana_up    # Analog Up
+ana_right # Analog Right
+ana_down  # Analog Down
+ana_left  # Analog Left
+rtrigger +ltrigger    #macro one, you must press all these buttons at the same time to run this macro. Specify the macro filename on the next line (or leave blank for none).
tek_asuka.txt
+cross +circle         #macro two, specify the macro filename on the next line (or leave blank for none)
test.txt

This is an example of running macros, you are allowed a maximum of 2 per remap set.

In this example if you press rtrigger and ltrigger at the same time it will run the macro in ms0:/remaps/macros/tek_asuka.txt
or if you press cross and circle at the same time it will run ms0:/remaps/macros/test.txt

While a macro is button NO INPUT IS ACTIVE. This is done on purpose, as a single button press macro will not press that button, it will just run the macro.
Also, the buttons you need to press are checked against the actual buttons you are pressing, not against the remapped ones.
